# Welcome to Tespera's Blog.
## quote：
It's the rule of the life that everything you have always wanted comes the very second you stop looking for it.

生活就是这样，你一直想要得到的东西，总是在你不再指望的那一刻姗姗来迟。

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Tespera/Tespera.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Tespera/Tespera.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
